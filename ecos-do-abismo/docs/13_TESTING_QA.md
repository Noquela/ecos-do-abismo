## **🔬 TESTING PYRAMID**

### **UNIT TESTING (Foundation)**
```
SCOPE: Individual functions and classes
COVERAGE TARGET: 80% of core gameplay logic
EXECUTION: Automated via GUT (Godot Unit Test)
FREQUENCY: Every commit

CRITICAL UNIT TESTS:
├── Player resource management (HP, Vontade, Corruption)
├── Card effect calculations
├── Enemy scaling formulas
├── Game state transitions
├── Combat damage calculations
├── Win/lose condition checks
├── Resource validation logic
└── Mathematical balancing functions

EXAMPLE TEST STRUCTURE:
func test_player_take_damage():
    var player = Player.new()
    var initial_hp = player.current_hp
    player.take_damage(25)
    assert_eq(player.current_hp, initial_hp - 25)
    assert_true(player.is_alive)

func test_card_vontade_cost():
    var player = Player.new()
    var card = Card.create_strong_attack()
    player.current_vontade = 2
    assert_false(card.can_play(player))  # Cost is 3
    player.current_vontade = 3
    assert_true(card.can_play(player))
```

### **INTEGRATION TESTING (System Interactions)**
```
SCOPE: Component interactions and data flow
COVERAGE TARGET: All critical user journeys
EXECUTION: Semi-automated + manual verification
FREQUENCY: Daily builds

CRITICAL INTEGRATION TESTS:
├── Card play → Enemy damage → UI update flow
├── Enemy death → New enemy spawn → Scaling
├── Player death → Game over → UI state
├── Resource changes → UI animation → Audio feedback
├── Turn progression → Vontade regeneration → Card availability
├── Corruption accumulation → Visual warnings → Death trigger
└── Input handling → Game logic → Visual response

EXAMPLE INTEGRATION TEST:
func test_complete_combat_flow():
    var game = setup_test_game()
    var initial_enemy_hp = game.current_enemy.current_hp

    # Player plays card
    var card = Card.create_weak_attack()
    game.play_card(card)

    # Verify chain reaction
    assert_lt(game.current_enemy.current_hp, initial_enemy_hp)
    assert_eq(game.player.current_vontade, 9)  # Cost deducted
    assert_true(game.ui_manager.is_updated)    # UI refreshed
```

### **SYSTEM TESTING (End-to-End)**
```
SCOPE: Complete gameplay sessions
COVERAGE TARGET: All player scenarios
EXECUTION: Manual testing with documented steps
FREQUENCY: Before each release

CRITICAL SYSTEM TESTS:
├── New player first session (0-15 minutes)
├── Extended gameplay session (15-30 minutes)
├── Difficulty progression validation
├── Resource exhaustion scenarios
├── Edge case combinations
├── Performance under stress
└── Recovery from error states

SYSTEM TEST SCENARIOS:
Scenario 1: Perfect New Player Experience
├── Launch game → See clear interface
├── Click first card → Immediate visual feedback
├── Enemy takes damage → Numbers appear
├── Enemy dies → New enemy spawns
├── Continue for 5 minutes → No confusion
├── Reach game over → Understand why
└── Want to play again immediately

Scenario 2: Extended Session
├── Play continuously for 20 minutes
├── Reach enemy level 10+
├── Experience all card types
├── Test resource management
├── Encounter high corruption scenarios
├── Verify performance remains stable
└── No memory leaks or slowdowns
```

### **USABILITY TEST SCRIPT**
```
PRE-TEST BRIEFING (5 minutes):
"You'll be testing a new card game. Please think aloud as you
play - tell me what you're thinking, what you expect to happen,
and how you feel about the experience. There are no right or
wrong answers, and any confusion helps us improve the game."

TASKS TO OBSERVE:
1. Launch and First Impression (0-30 seconds)
   ├── Does the player know what to do?
   ├── Is the interface clear and inviting?
   ├── Do they find the primary action (cards)?
   └── Any immediate confusion or hesitation?

2. First Action (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
   ├── Do they successfully play a card?
   ├── Do they understand the result?
   ├── Is the feedback clear and satisfying?
   └── Do they want to continue?

3. Core Loop Understanding (2-5 minutes)
   ├── Do they grasp the resource system?
   ├── Do they understand the risk/reward?
   ├── Can they explain the goal in their words?
   └── Are they making strategic decisions?

4. Extended Play (5-15 minutes)
   ├── Do they develop a strategy?
   ├── Do they understand progression?
   ├── How do they react to first death?
   ├── Do they immediately restart?

POST-TEST INTERVIEW (10 minutes):
